 * @defgroup    dxgrLibFCI  LibFCI
 * @brief       This is Fast Control Interface available for host applications to
 *              communicate with the networking engine.
 * @details     The FCI is intended to provide a generic configuration and monitoring interface
 *              for the networking acceleration HW. Provided API shall remain the same within all
 *              HW/OS-specific implementations to keep dependent applications portable across
 *              various systems.
 *
 *              The LibFCI is not directly touching the HW. Instead, it only passes commands to
 *              a dedicated software component (OS/HW-specific endpoint) and receives return values.
 *              The endpoint is then responsible for HW configuration. This approach supports
 *              a kernel-user space deployment where the user space contains only API and the logic is
 *              implemented in kernel.
 *
 *              Implementation uses appropriate transport mechanism to pass data between
 *              LibFCI user and the endpoint. For reference: in Linux a netlink socket is used;
 *              in QNX a message is used.
 *
 * @section     how_to_use  How to use the FCI API
 * @subsection  fciuse_cmd  Sending FCI commands
 *              -# Call @ref fci_open() to get an @ref FCI_CLIENT instance, using @ref FCI_GROUP_NONE
 *                 as a multicast group mask. This opens a connection to an FCI endpoint.
 *              -# Call @ref fci_write() or @ref fci_query() to send a command to the endpoint. <br> See @ref fci_cs.
 *                 - Endpoint receives the command and executes requested actions.
 *                 - Endpoint generates a response and sends it back to the client.
 *              -# [optional] Repeat the previous step to send all requested FCI commands.
 *              -# Call @ref fci_close() to finalize the @ref FCI_CLIENT instance.
 * @subsection  fci_owner  FCI ownership in Master-Slave setup
 *              The FCI ownership applies only to PFE driver Master-Slave setup. This feature ensures that at any given time
 *              there is only one driver instance which can successfully issue FCI commands.
 *              Configuration of FCI Ownership is stored in the Master instance. The configuration specifies
 *              which driver instances are allowed to acquire FCI ownership.
 *
 *              There can be only one FCI owner at a time. Only the FCI commands issued by the FCI
 *              owner can be executed successfully. FCI commands issued by a driver instance which
 *              does not have FCI ownership are never executed and return an error code instead.
 *              Driver instance can acquire or release the FCI ownership via the following means:
 *                 - <b>Manually</b>, by requesting the FCI ownership via dedicated FCI commands
 *              @ref FPP_CMD_FCI_OWNERSHIP_LOCK and @ref FPP_CMD_FCI_OWNERSHIP_UNLOCK.
 *              If the ownership is acquired manually, it has to be manually released as well
 *              (responsibility of the requesting driver).
 *                 - <b>Automatically</b>, by acquiring floating FCI ownership if it is not held at the moment by
 *              other client. The floating FCI ownership is granted temporarily for each issued FCI
 *              command. Once the execution of the respective FCI command is finished, the FCI
 *              ownership is automatically released, so other sender can take FCI ownership.

 * @subsection  fciuse_msg  Asynchronous message processing
 *              -# User calls @ref fci_open() to get the @ref FCI_CLIENT instance. It is
 *                 important to set @ref FCI_GROUP_CATCH bit in multicast group mask.
 *              -# User calls @ref fci_register_cb() to register custom function for handling
 *                 asynchronous messages from PFE.
 *              -# User calls @ref fci_catch() function.
 *              -# For each received message, the @ref fci_catch() calls previously registered
 *                 callback.
 *              -# When the callback returns @ref FCI_CB_CONTINUE, the @ref fci_catch() function
 *                 waits for another message.
 *              -# When the callback returns @ref FCI_CB_STOP or when error occurred,

 * @subsection  mgmt_phyif  Physical Interface
 *              Physical interfaces are static objects (defined at startup), which represent hardware
 *              interfaces of PFE. They are used by PFE for ingress/egress of network traffic.
 *
 *              Physical interfaces have several configurable properties. See @ref FPP_CMD_PHY_IF
 *              and @ref fpp_phy_if_cmd_t. Among all these properties, a `.mode` property
 *              is especially important. Mode of a physical interface specifies which classification
 *              algorithm shall be applied on ingress traffic of the interface.
 *
 *              Every physical interface can have a list of logical interfaces.
 *              By default, all physical interfaces are in a default mode (@ref FPP_IF_OP_DEFAULT).
 *              In the default mode, ingress traffic of a given physical interface is processed using
 *              only the associated @b default @ref mgmt_logif.

 * @subsection  mgmt_logif  Logical Interface
 *              Logical interfaces are dynamic objects (definable at runtime) which represent traffic endpoints.
 *              They are associated with their respective parent physical interfaces. Logical interfaces
 *              can be used for the following purposes:
 *              - To forward traffic from PFE to a host.
 *              - To forward traffic or its replicas between physical interfaces (1:N distribution).
 *              - To serve as classification & forwarding rules for @ref flex_router.
 *
 *              Logical interfaces have several configurable properties. See @ref FPP_CMD_LOG_IF
 *              and @ref fpp_log_if_cmd_t.
 *
 *              Logical interfaces can be created and destroyed at runtime. Every @e physical interface
 *              can have a list of associated @e logical interfaces. The very first logical interface
 *              in the list (tail position) is considered the @b default logical interface of the given
 *              physical interface. New logical interfaces are always added to the top of the list (head position),
 *              creating a sequence which is ordered from the head (the newest one) back to the tail (the default one).
 *              This forms a classification sequence, which is important if the parent physical interface
 *              operates in the Flexible Router mode.
 *
 *              Similar to physical interfaces, the logical interfaces can be set to a @b promiscuous mode.
 *              For logical interfaces, a promiscuous mode means a logical interface will accept all
 *              ingress traffic it is asked to classify, regardless of the interface's active match rules.

 * @subsection  l3_router  IPv4/IPv6 Router (TCP/UDP)
 *              Introduction
 *              ------------
 *              IPv4/IPv6 Router is a dedicated feature to offload a host from tasks
 *              related to forwarding of specific IP packets between physical interfaces.
 *              Without the offload, IP packets are passed to the host's TCP/IP stack and
 *              the host is responsible for routing of packets. That is "slow path" routing.
 *              PFE can be configured to provide "fast path" routing, identifying IP packets
 *              which can be forwarded directly by PFE (using its internal routing table)
 *              without host intervention.
 *
 *              Configuration
 *              -------------
 *              -# [optional] Reset the Router.
 *                 <br> This clears all existing IPv4/IPv6 routes and conntracks in PFE.

 *              -# Create one or more IPv4/IPv6 routes.
 *                 <br> (@ref FPP_CMD_IP_ROUTE + FPP_ACTION_REGISTER)

 *                 <br> (@ref FPP_CMD_IPV4_CONNTRACK + FPP_ACTION_REGISTER)
 *                 <br> (@ref FPP_CMD_IPV6_CONNTRACK + FPP_ACTION_REGISTER)
 *              -# Configure the physical interfaces which shall classify their ingress traffic
 *                 by the Router classification algorithm. Use steps described in
 *                 @ref mgmt_phyif (section @b modify) and do the following for each desired physical interface:
 *                 - Set mode of the interface to @ref FPP_IF_OP_ROUTER.
 *                 - Enable the interface by setting the flag @ref FPP_IF_ENABLED.
 *
 *              Once the Router is operational, all ingress IP packets of the Router-configured physical
 *              interfaces are matched against existing conntracks using a 5-tuple match (protocol, source IP,
 *              destination IP, source port, destination port). If a packet matches some existing conntrack,
 *              it is processed and modified according to conntrack's properties (destination MAC, NAT, PAT, etc.)
 *              and then gets fast-forwarded to an egress physical interface as specified by the conntrack's route.
 *
 *              Additional operations
 *              ---------------------
 *              Conntracks are subjected to aging. If no matching packets are detected on a conntrack
 *              for a specified time period, the conntrack is automatically removed from PFE.
 *              To @b set the @b timeout period, use the following command (shared for both
 *              IPv4 and IPv6 conntracks):
 *              <br> (@ref FPP_CMD_IPV4_SET_TIMEOUT)
 *
 *              <br>

 *              Note: <br>
 *              Removing a route which is used by some conntracks causes the associated connntracks
 *              to be removed as well.
 *              </small> <br>

 *
 *              By default, PFE conntracks decrement TTL of processed IP packets. This behavior can be
 *              set/unset for individual conntracks by their flag @ref CTCMD_FLAGS_TTL_DECREMENT.

 * @subsection  l2_bridge  L2 Bridge (Switch)
 *              Introduction
 *              ------------
 *              L2 Bridge is a dedicated feature to offload a host from tasks related
 *              to MAC address-based forwarding of Ethernet frames. PFE can be configured
 *              to act as a network switch, implementing the following functionality:
 *              - <b>MAC table:</b>
 *                L2 Bridge uses its own MAC table to keep track of encountered MAC addresses.
 *                Each MAC table entry consists of a MAC address and a physical interface
 *                which should be used to reach the given MAC address. MAC table entries can
 *                be dynamic (learned) or static.
 *              - <b>MAC address learning:</b>
 *                L2 Bridge is capable of automatically adding (learning) new MAC table entries from
 *                ingress frames with new (not yet encountered) source MAC addresses.
 *              - <b>Aging:</b>
 *                MAC table entries are subjected to aging. If a MAC table entry is not used for
 *                a certain (hardcoded) time period, it is automatically removed from the MAC table.
 *                Static entries are not affected by aging.
 *              - <b>Static entries:</b>
 *                It is possible to manually add static (non-aging) entries to the MAC table.
 *                Static entries can be used as a part of L2 Bridge forward-only configuration
 *                (with MAC learning disabled). With such a setup, only a predetermined
 *                traffic (matching the static entries) will be forwarded.
 *              - <b>Blocking states of physical interfaces:</b>
 *                Each physical interface which is configured to be a part of the L2 Bridge can
 *                be finetuned to allow/deny MAC learning or frame forwarding of its ingress traffic.
 *                See @ref fpp_phy_if_block_state_t.
 *              - <b>Port migration:</b>
 *                If there is already a learned MAC table entry (a MAC address + a target physical interface)
 *                and the MAC address is detected on another interface, then the entry is automatically
 *                updated (new target physical interface is set).
 *              - <b>VLAN Awareness:</b>
 *                The L2 Bridge uses its own VLAN table to support VLAN-based policies
 *                like Ingress or Egress port membership. It also supports configuration of bridge
 *                domain ports (represented by physical interfaces) to provide VLAN tagging and
 *                untagging services, effectively allowing creation of access / trunk ports.
 *
 *              The L2 Bridge utilizes PFE HW accelerators to perform highly optimized MAC and VLAN
 *              table lookups. Host is responsible only for the initial bridge configuration via
 *              the FCI API.
 *
 *              L2 Bridge VLAN Awareness and Domains
 *              ------------------------------------
 *              The VLAN awareness is based on entities called Bridge Domains (BD), which are visible to
 *              both the classifier firmware and the driver. BDs are used to abstract particular VLANs.
 *              Every BD has a configurable set of properties (see @ref fpp_l2_bd_cmd_t):
 *              - Associated VLAN ID.
 *              - Set of physical interfaces which represent ports of the BD.
 *              - Information about which ports are tagged or untagged.
 *                - Tagged port adds a VLAN tag to egressed frames if they are not VLAN tagged, or keeps
 *                  the tag of the frames intact if they are already VLAN tagged.
 *                - Untagged port removes the VLAN tag from egressed frames if the frames are VLAN tagged.
 *              - Instruction how to process matching uni-cast frames.
 *              - Instruction how to process matching multi-cast frames.
 *
 *              The L2 Bridge recognizes several BD types:
 *              - <b>Default BD:</b> @anchor ref__default_bd <br>
 *                Factory default VLAN ID of this bridge domain is @b 1.
 *                This domain is used to process ingress frames which either have a VLAN tag equal
 *                to the Default BD's VLAN ID, or don't have a VLAN tag at all (untagged Ethernet frames).
 *              - <b>Fall-back BD:</b> <br>
 *                This domain is used to process ingress frames which have an unknown VLAN tag.
 *                Unknown VLAN tag means that the VLAN tag does not match any existing standard BD nor the default BD.
 *              - <b>Standard BD:</b> <br>
 *                Standard user-defined bridge domains. Used by a VLAN-aware Bridge. These BDs
 *                process ingress frames which have a VLAN tag that matches the BD's VLAN ID.
 *
 *              Configuration
 *              -------------
 *              -# Create a bridge domain (VLAN domain).
 *                 <br> (@ref FPP_CMD_L2_BD + FPP_ACTION_REGISTER)

 *                 <br> (@ref FPP_CMD_L2_BD + FPP_ACTION_UPDATE)
 *              -# Repeat previous steps to create all required bridge domains (VLAN domains).
 *                 Physical interfaces can be members of multiple bridge domains.
 *              -# Configure the physical interfaces which shall classify their ingress traffic
 *                 by the VLAN-aware Bridge classification algorithm. Use steps described in
 *                 @ref mgmt_phyif (section @b modify) and do the following for each desired physical interface:
 *                 - Set mode of the interface to @ref FPP_IF_OP_VLAN_BRIDGE.
 *                 - Enable the promiscuous mode by setting the flag @ref FPP_IF_PROMISC.
 *                 - Enable the interface by setting the flag @ref FPP_IF_ENABLED.
 *
 *              Once the L2 Bridge is operational, ingress Ethernet frames of the Bridge-configured
 *              physical interfaces are processed according to setup of bridge domains. VLAN tag of
 *              every ingress frame is inspected and the frame is then processed by an appropriate bridge domain.

 *              ------------
 *              L2L3 Bridge is an extension of the L2 Bridge and IP Router features.
 *              It allows both features to be simultaneously available on a physical interface.
 *              Traffic with specific destination MAC addresses is passed to the IP Router.

 *                A classification rule. See @ref FPP_CMD_FP_RULE.
 *                FP rules inspect content of Ethernet frames. Based on the inspection result

 *                  Flexible Filter acts as a traffic filter, pre-emptively discarding ingress traffic
 *                  which is rejected by the associated FP table. Accepted traffic is then processed
 *                  according to mode of the physical interface.

 *
 *              Flexible Parser classification introduces a performance penalty which is proportional to a count
 *              of rules and complexity of a used table. Always consider whether the use of this feature is

 *
 *              Configuration
 *              -------------
 *              -# Create one or multiple FP rules.

 *                 <br> (@ref FPP_CMD_FP_TABLE + FPP_ACTION_UNUSE_RULE)
 *              -# Use FP tables wherever they are required. See @link ref__fp_table FP table @endlink.
 *
 *              @b WARNING: <br>
 *              Do not modify FP tables which are already in use! Always first remove the FP table
 *              from use, then modify it (add/delete/rearrange rules), then put it back to its use.
 *              Failure to adhere to this warning will result in an undefined behavior of Flexible Parser.
 *              <br>
 *
 *              Once an FP table is configured and put to use, it will start classifying the ingress traffic
 *              in whatever role it was assigned to (see @link ref__fp_table FP table @endlink).
 *              Classification always starts from the very first rule of the table (index 0). Normally,
 *              rules of the table are evaluated sequentially till the traffic is either accepted, rejected,
 *              or the end of the table is reached. If the end of the table is reached and the traffic is
 *              still not accepted nor rejected, then Flexible Parser automatically rejects it.
 *
 *              Based on the action of an FP rule, it is possible to make a jump from the currently
 *              evaluated rule to any other rule in the same table. This can be used in some complex scenarios.
 *
 *              @b WARNING: <br>
 *              It is prohibited to use jumps to create loops. Failure to adhere to this warning
 *              will result in an undefined behavior of Flexible Parser.
 *
 *              Additional operations
 *              ---------------------
 *              It is advised to always remove rules and tables which are not needed, because these
 *              unused objects would needlessly occupy limited internal memory of PFE. To @b remove
 *              an FP rule or an FP table:

 *              ----------------
 *              This is an example of how a Flexible Parser table can look like.
 *              - Every row is one FP rule.
 *              - The classification process starts from the rule 0.
 *              - ACCEPT/REJECT means the classification is terminated with the given result.
 *              - CONTINUE means that the next rule in a sequence (next row) shall be evaluated.
 *              - NEXT_RULE <name> means that the next rule to evaluate shall be the rule <name>.
 *              - FrameData is an inspected value from an ingress Ethernet frame.
 *                Each rule can inspect a different value from the frame.
 *                See @ref FPP_CMD_FP_RULE and @ref fpp_fp_rule_props_t, fields `.offset` and `.offset_from`.
 *              - RuleData is a template value inside the FP rule. It is compared with the inspected value
 *                from the ingress Ethernet frame.
 *              - Mask is a bitmask specifying which bits of the RuleData and FrameData shall be compared

 * @subsection  flex_router  Flexible Router
 *              Introduction
 *              ------------
 *              Flexible Router is a PFE firmware-based feature which uses logical interfaces
 *              (and their match rules) to classify ingress traffic. Replicas of the accepted traffic
 *              can be forwarded to one or multiple physical interfaces.
 *
 *              Flexible Router classification introduces a performance penalty which is proportional to a count
 *              of used logical interfaces (and their match rules). Always consider whether the use of this feature
 *              is really necessary. If it is necessary, then try to use as few logical interfaces as possible.
 *
 *              Configuration
 *              -------------
 *              -# Lock the interface database.
 *                 <br> (@ref FPP_CMD_IF_LOCK_SESSION)
 *              -# Create one or multiple logical interfaces. See @ref mgmt_logif for more info.
 *                 For Flexible Router purposes, pay attention to the order of logical interfaces.
 *                 <br> (@ref FPP_CMD_LOG_IF + FPP_ACTION_REGISTER)
 *              -# Configure the logical interfaces. Use steps described in
 *                 @ref mgmt_logif (section @b modify) and do the following for each desired logical interface:
 *                 - [optional] Set interface properties such as egress, match rules and match rule arguments.
 *                 - [optional] If multiple match rules are used, then set or clear the flag
 *                   @ref FPP_IF_MATCH_OR in order to specify a logical relation between the rules.
 *                 - Enable the interface by setting the flag @ref FPP_IF_ENABLED.
 *              -# Configure the physical interfaces which shall classify their ingress traffic
 *                 by the Flexible Router classification algorithm. Use steps described in
 *                 @ref mgmt_phyif (section @b modify) and do the following for each desired physical interface:
 *                 - Set mode of the interface to @ref FPP_IF_OP_FLEXIBLE_ROUTER.
 *                 - Enable the interface by setting the flag @ref FPP_IF_ENABLED.
 *              -# Unlock the interface database with @ref FPP_CMD_IF_UNLOCK_SESSION.
 *
 *              Once the Flexible Router is operational, it classifies the ingress traffic of
 *              Flexible Router-configured physical interfaces. The process is based on the
 *              classification sequence of logical interfaces (see @ref mgmt_logif). Classifier walks
 *              through the sequence from the head position back to tail, matching the ingress
 *              traffic against match rules of logical interfaces which are in the sequence.
 *              If a match is found (traffic conforms with match rules of the given logical interface),
 *              then the traffic is processed according to the interface's configuration (forwarded,
 *              dropped, sent to a host, etc.).
 *
 *              Configuration example
 *              ---------------------
 *              This example shows a scenario where emac1 physical interface is configured in
 *              the @ref FPP_IF_OP_FLEXIBLE_ROUTER mode. Goal is to classify ingress traffic
 *              on emac1 interface. If the traffic matches classification criteria,
 *              a replica of the traffic is egressed through both emac2 and hif0 interfaces.
 *              <br>
 *              @image latex flexible_router.eps "Configuration Example" width=7cm
 *              -# Traffic is ingressed (received) through emac1 port of PFE.
 *              -# Classifier walks through the list of logical interfaces associated with the emac1
 *                 physical interface.
 *              -# If some logical interface accepts the traffic, then information about the matching
 *                 logical interface (and its parent physical interface) is passed to the Routing and
 *                 Forwarding Algorithm. Algorithm reads the logical interface and retrieves forwarding properties.
 *              -# Traffic is forwarded by the Routing and Forwarding Algorithm based on the provided information.
 *                 In this example, the logical interface specified that a replica of the traffic shall be
 *                 forwarded to both emac2 and hif0 interfaces.
 *              -# Traffic is transmitted via physical interfaces.

 *              Introduction
 *              ------------
 *              The IPsec offload feature is a premium one and requires a special premium firmware version
 *              to be available for use. It allows the chosen IP frames to be transparently encoded by the IPsec and
 *              IPsec frames to be transparently decoded without the CPU intervention using just the PFE and HSE engines.
 *
 *              @b WARNING: <br>
 *              The IPsec offload feature is available only for some Premium versions of PFE firmware.
 *              The feature should @b not be used with a firmware which does not support it.
 *              Failure to adhere to this warning will result in an undefined behavior of PFE.
 *              <br>
 *
 *              The SPD database needs to be established on an interface which contains entries describing frame
 *              match criteria together with the SA ID reference to the SA established within the HSE describing
 *              the IPsec processing criteria. Frames matching the criteria are then processed by the HSE according
 *              to the chosen SA and returned for the classification via physical interface of UTIL PE. Normal
 *              classification follows the IPsec processing thus the decrypted packets can be e.g. routed.
 *
 *              <br>Supported operations related to the IPsec offload:
 *
 *              To @b create a new SPD entry in the SPD table of a physical interface:

 *
 *              The HSE also requires the configuration via interfaces of the HSE firmware which is out of the scope of this
 *              document. The SAs referenced within the SPD entries must exist prior creation of the respective SPD entry.

 *              ------------
 *              The Egress QoS allows user to prioritize, aggregate and shape traffic intended to
 *              leave the accelerator through some @link mgmt_phyif physical interface @endlink.
 *              Egress QoS is implemented as follows:
 *              - Each @b emac physical interface has its own QoS block.
 *              - All @b hif physical interfaces share one common QoS block.
 *
 *              Every QoS block has a platform-specific number of queues, schedulers and shapers.
 *
 *              @if S32G2

 *                       Queues of @b hif interfaces:
 *                       Every hif interface has only @b 2 queues, indexed as follows:
 *                         - [0] : low priority queue (L)
 *                         - [1] : high priority queue (H)
 *
 *                       Use only these indexes if hif queues are configured via FCI commands.
 *                       </small>
 *                - @b Schedulers:

 *              Queue slot pools @anchor ref__queue_slot_pools
 *              ----------------
 *              Every QoS block has it own pool of queue slots. These slots can be assigned to particular queues.
 *              Length of a queue is equal to number of assigned slots. It is possible to configure queue lengths via FCI API.
 *              Setting a queue length (@link fpp_qos_queue_cmd_t @endlink.max) means assigning given number of slots to the given queue.
 *              Sum of all queue lengths of the particular physical interface cannot be bigger than size of its queue slot pool.
 *
 *              See section @link ref__queues Queues @endlink for info about queue slot pool sizes for various physical interfaces.
 *              <small><br><br>
 *              Examples of queue slots distribution:
 *              - Asymmetrical queue slots distribution for @b emac0.
 *                Only 241 slots of the emac0 are used. Emac0 still has 14 free queue slots which could be used to
 *                lenghten some emac0 queues, if needed.
 *                  - queue 0 : 150 slots
 *                  - queues 1 .. 7 : 13 slots per each queue
 *              - Symmetrical queue slots distribution for @b hif0.
 *                All 32 queue slots of the hif0 are used. There are no free queue slots left on hif0.

 * @subsection  ingress_qos Ingress QoS
 *              Introduction
 *              ------------
 *              The Ingress QoS allows user to prioritize, aggregate and shape traffic as
 *              it comes into the accelerator through an @b emac @link mgmt_phyif physical interface @endlink,
 *              before it is further processed by the accelerator.
 *
 *              Each @b emac physical interface has its own Ingress QoS Policer block.
 *              Every Policer block has its dedicated flow classification table, WRED queues and Ingress QoS shapers.
 *              Exact size of flow classification table and exact numbers/limits of WRED queues and
 *              Ingress QoS shapers are platform-specific.
 *
 *              @if S32G2
 *                The following applies for each @b S32G2/PFE Ingress QoS block ("policer"):
 *                - @b Flow classification table:
 *                     - Maximum number of flows: 64
 *
 *                - @b WRED queues:
 *                     - Number of queues: 3 (DMEM, LMEM, RXF)
 *                     - Maximum queue depth: 8192 for DMEM ; 512 for LMEM and RXF
 *                     - Probability zones per queue: 4
 *
 *                - @b Ingress @b QoS @b shapers:
 *                     - Number of shapers: 2
 *              @endif
 *
 *              Configuration
 *              -------------
 *              By default, the Ingress QoS block ("policer") is organized as follows:
 *              @verbatim

 *                    - Flow classification table. Contains user-defined flows.
 *                    - Each flow represents a certain criteria, such as traffic type to match
 *                      (VLAN, ARP, IPv4, etc.) or some data within the traffic to match
 *                      (match VLAN ID, match IP address, etc).
 *                    - Ingressing traffic is compared with flows and their criteria.
 *                      If traffic matches some flow, then (based on flow action), the traffic gets
 *                      either dropped or marked as Managed or Reserved.
 *                      Traffic which does not match any flow from the table is marked as Unmanaged.

 *                    - Ingress QoS WRED queues. These queues (by HW design) always use WRED algorithm.
 *                    - Individual queues can be disabled. If all queues are disabled,
 *                      then the WRED queueing module is bypassed.
 *                    - Traffic is queued (or possibly dropped) based on the momentary queue fill and
 *                      also based on the marking of the traffic (Unmanaged/Managed/Reserved).

 *                      to ensure optimal data flow.
 *                    - Individual shapers can be disabled. If all shapers are disabled,
 *                      then the Ingress QoS shaper module is bypassed.
 *                    - Shapers can be assigned to shape one of several predefined traffic types.
